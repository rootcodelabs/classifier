    - After logging in, you will be redirected to a page with text box and value in the text box will be your **OUTLOOK_REFRESH_KEY**.
    - Add this value to the `constants.ini` file and the `DSL/CronManager/config/config.ini` files.


### Jira Setup

1. **Generate API Token:**
   - Navigate to [Atlassian Profile](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile) and log in with your Jira credentials.
   - Click on the **Security** tab.
   - Scroll down to the **API Token** section, and click on `Create and manage API tokens`.
   - Click on **Create API Token** to generate a new token. **This token will serve as your `JIRA_API_TOKEN`.** Make sure to store it securely as it will be used later.

2. **Create Jira Webhook:**
   - Navigate to your **Jira Account** (This is where Jira issues will be created and predicted).
   - Go to **Settings → System → WebHooks**.
   - Click `Create WebHook` and configure it as follows:
     - **URL**: `Base_URL/webhook` (Replace `Base_URL` with the actual URL of your `jira-verification` container deployed in your infrastructure).
     - Under Events, select the checkboxes for `Issue Created` and `Issue Updated` to trigger the webhook upon these actions.
     - **Webhook Secret**: After creating the webhook, you will receive a `JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. **Save this secret as you will need to add it to your configuration files.**

3. **Set Values in `constants.ini`:**
   - Add the following values in your `constants.ini` file:
     - `JIRA_API_TOKEN` – The API token generated in step 1.
     - `JIRA_USERNAME` – Your Jira username. To find your Jira username, navigate to your profile in Jira, and it will be displayed under your account information.
     - `JIRA_CLOUD_DOMAIN` – The domain URL of your Jira cloud instance (e.g., `https://example.atlassian.net`).
     - `JIRA_WEBHOOK_ID` – You can retrieve this using steps provided under Retrievening Jira Webhook ID.
     - `JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` – Jira webhook secret you got in **Create Jira Webhook** step.

4. **Create a `.env` file for Jira Configuration:**
   - Create a `.env` file called `jira_config.env` and add the following:
     ```env
     JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<<JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET>>
     ```

### Retrieving Jira Webhook ID

To get the `JIRA_WEBHOOK_ID`, use the following CURL request with your Jira email and API token:

```bash
curl -X GET -u your-email@example.com:your-api-token -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://<JIRA_CLOUD_DOMAIN>/rest/webhooks/1.0/webhook
```

In the response, the webhook ID can be found in the `self` attribute. For example:

```json
"self": "https://example.net/rest/webhooks/1.0/webhook/1"
```

In this case, the `JIRA_WEBHOOK_ID` is `1`.

### Configuration for `config.env`

This file contains environment variables that are necessary for the operation of the application. Below is an explanation of each value, with a focus on obtaining the AWS S3-related values.

#### S3 Configuration Variables

1. **S3_REGION**:
   - This is the AWS region where your S3 bucket is located. For example, `eu-west-1` is the region for Ireland.
   - To find your S3 region:
     - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
     - Navigate to **S3**.
     - Look at the top-right corner of the S3 dashboard to see your region (e.g., `eu-west-1`, `us-east-1`).

2. **S3_ENDPOINT_URL**:
   - This is the endpoint URL for your S3 bucket in the specified region.
   - You can find this by:
     - Navigating to your S3 bucket.
     - AWS provides the region-specific endpoint. For example, for the `eu-west-1` region, the endpoint is `https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`.

3. **S3_DATA_BUCKET_NAME**:
   - This is the name of the S3 bucket where your data will be stored.
   - To find or create your S3 bucket:
     - Go to the AWS **S3** dashboard.
     - If you already have a bucket, use its name.
     - To create a new bucket, click on **Create Bucket**, name it (e.g., `esclassifier-test`), and configure its settings.

4. **S3_DATA_BUCKET_PATH**:
   - This specifies the path within your S3 bucket where data will be stored. In this example, it's `data/`.
   - You can customize the directory structure within your bucket as per your project needs.

5. **S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**:
   - These are the AWS access keys used to authenticate and authorize access to your S3 bucket.
   - To generate these keys:
     - Navigate to the **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) section in AWS.
     - Create a new user (or use an existing one) with **Programmatic Access** enabled.
     - Attach a policy that grants S3 permissions (such as `AmazonS3FullAccess` or a custom policy).
     - After creating the user, AWS will provide an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**. Store these values securely.

#### Local File System Path

6. **FS_DATA_DIRECTORY_PATH**:
   - This is the directory path on the local file system where data will be stored. Usually, this value is set to `/shared`.
   - It is useful for storing files locally in addition to, or instead of, uploading them to S3.

#### Other Configuration Variables

7. **API_CORS_ORIGIN**:
   - The value `*` means that the API allows requests from any domain (cross-origin resource sharing is fully open). This is useful during development but should be restricted to specific domains in production for security reasons.

8. **API_DOCUMENTATION_ENABLED**:
   - When set to `true`, this enables automatic generation of API documentation, such as Swagger or Redoc. This is helpful for developers to interact with and understand the API’s endpoints.

Ensure that your AWS credentials (S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID and S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are stored securely and never exposed publicly. It's recommended to use services like AWS Secrets Manager for production environments.

##### Ruuter Internal Requests

- When running ruuter either on local or in an environment make sure to adjust `- application.internalRequests.allowedIPs=127.0.0.1,{YOUR_IPS}` under ruuter environments

## Ngrok setup for local testing
To setup JIRA and Outlook integrations locally you need an https URL as a webhook. Since localhost by default http JIRA and Outlook APIs wouldn't be able to call your webhook endpoint if it's in localhost. You can overcome this by creating a ngrok tunnel to your localhost ports 3008 (JIRA Integration) and 8086 (Outlook Integration). And then provide the https URLs you receive from ngrok as webhook callback endpoints in JIRA and Outlook configurations
